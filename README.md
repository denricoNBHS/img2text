So the only thing you could change is 
```
python3 img2text.py [img/surprised_pikachu.jpg] [10] [80] [img/surprised_pikachu.txt]

```
This code 
```
python3
```
declared what python version you are using, there are other version but **don't change** that first code
The second part 
```
img2text.py
```
is the file that contain the script of conveting image to another on.**Don't change that line either**

The third part is 
```
img/surprised_pikachu.jpg
```
it is where  the image of the file is located, and it tell what is being used. If you want to put another image then run this code cd img
and then add the file, then instead of that code img/surprised_pikachu.jpg, put img/"what even your file is".
The fourth part
```
10
```
Is the nubmer of color to be shown on the picture. That **max** is 10 and **min** is 1.
The fifth part
```
80
```
This is  changing the width to 80 by scale factor. You can change it to any thing else, but 80 is the best on to use.
The last part 
```
img/surprised_pikachu.txt
```
Last but not least 
img/surprised_pikachu.txt is where the result  be send to, so it will be send to the img directory, where the file will be called
surprised_pikachu.txt. If you want to rename that file you can do something like this img/"what ever file name you want"
