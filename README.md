python3 is the version of python that we are using 
img2text.py is the file we are using
img/surprised_pikachu is the image that we are going to use to convert to text
10 is the amount of colors ( we can not go passed more than 10 colors) and it has to be a number it can not be writen out.
120 is the output  width of the image so it can be any number.
tempt.text is where we store the text and we can also use cat temp.text to see the text but it doesnt really need to be temp.text it can be anything.
for the output width it has to be an integer data type.
